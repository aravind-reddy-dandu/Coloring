# Coloring
Coloring a Black and image using models trained on one half of image\
Below is the brief description of task

1) Pick an image of choice
2) Convert the whole image to black and white(grey-scale)
3) Split into two halves
4) Learn from left half about how it is colored(using original image left half)
5) Use this information to color the right half


Basic Agent: Using Kmeans, KNN, KD Tree\
Regression: Using Linear, Lasso, Ridge Regression on patches\
Neural Networks: Written code from scratch. Training on patches\
Neural Networks using Tensorflow
